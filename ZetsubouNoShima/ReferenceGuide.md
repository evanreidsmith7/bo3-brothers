## Turn on the Power

### Temporary Power

There are two temporary power switches that you need to activate before accessing the main power. These are located in different areas of the map, one near the Blue Water and the other near the Green Water. Turning on both switches will temporarily power the doors to the bunker.

### Permanent Power

Once the bunker is accessible, find your way through to the main power room. You will need to clear webs with explosives or the KT-4, and activate the permanent power switch inside.

## Obtain the Skull of Nan Sapwe

### Collect Skulls

At the spawn area, you'll see a pedestal with four skulls. Each skull corresponds to an altar around the map, marked with a symbol. Pick up a skull and place it on the correct altar. Defend the skull from zombies until it is purified.

### Rituals Room

Once all skulls are cleansed, bring them back to the initial pedestal, and place them to unlock the underground ritual room. Complete the ritual to obtain the Skull of Nan Sapwe.

## Build the KT-4 Wonder Weapon

### Collect Parts

- **Vial of Plant Fluid:** Kill a zombie near the plants that spit spores to collect this.
- **Spider Venom:** Kill a spider boss in the cave during a spider round.
- **Glowing Plant:** This part is obtained from the underwater area near the A lab.

### Assemble the KT-4

Once you have all parts, go to the lab and build the KT-4 on the workbench.

## Upgrade the KT-4 to the Masamune

### Obtain Rainbow Water

Use the KT-4 to shoot the ceiling of the cave where you fight spiders to reveal a hidden area with Rainbow Water.

### Grow the Plant

Use the Rainbow Water to water a seed underwater for three consecutive rounds.

### Collect the Masamune Part

After three rounds, harvest the plant to get a part.

### Build the Masamune

Return to the lab and upgrade the KT-4 into the Masamune.

## Obtain Cog Pieces

- **First Cog:** Ride the zip line and melee or shoot the control box mid-ride to drop into a previously inaccessible area to collect the cog.
- **Second Cog:** Use a Monkey Bomb or similar to lure a Thrasher under the trap in the B lab area. Activate the trap to get the cog.
- **Third Cog:** Complete a challenge that involves an underwater area. Once you complete it, you'll get the cog from a chest.

## Complete Individual Challenges

### Challenges

Every player has three personal challenges that appear on pillars near the spawn. Complete these challenges to contribute to the team's progress. These challenges vary from killing zombies with specific methods to eating fruits from plants.

#### Kill 15 zombies attracted to plants

- For this challenge, the player has to water a planted seed three times using purple water.
- After that, a plant that attracts and kills zombies will grow.
- To complete the challenge, the player simply has to kill the zombies that are attracted to the plant, before the plant kills them.

## Access the Boss Fight

Use the Elevator: After collecting all the cogs, install them in the elevator mechanism. Use the elevator to descend to the boss fight area.

## Fight the Final Boss

### Boss Mechanics

The final boss is a mutated Takeo. Avoid his attacks, and clear waves of zombies. Use the Masamune and Skull of Nan Sapwe to deal damage. Focusing on his glowing spots when exposed is crucial.

## Finish the Easter Egg

### End Game

Upon defeating the boss, watch the cutscene that reveals more about the Zombies storyline.

## My Notes

### current challenges

```bash
#### kill 3 zombies as they are mutating

- status: 

#### Obtain powerup from plant

- status: 

#### use a spore to regain air underwater

- status: 0/30

```

#### Use a Spore to Regain Air Underwater

1. **Locate a Spore:** Find spores in underwater areas of the map, particularly in the power room and near the Mule Kick.

2. **Destroy the Spore:** Approach the spore and destroy it to release a cloud.

3. **Enter the Cloud:** Immediately enter the cloud left by the destroyed spore.

4. **Regain Air:** Instead of coughing, you will regain air while in the cloud, completing the challenge.

#### Kill 3 Zombies as They Are Mutating

1. **Identify Mutating Zombies**
Zombies mutate into more powerful forms (like Thrashers) when they come into contact with spores. You'll know a zombie is about to mutate because it begins to puff up and change form near these spores.

2. **Locate Spores**
Walk around the map and find the large orange spores attached to walls and trees. These are more frequent in swampy areas.

3. **Bait Zombies**
Lead zombies near these spores but don’t destroy the spores yet. It’s best to have a small group of zombies to increase your chances that one will begin mutating.

4. **Trigger Mutation**
Shoot a spore as zombies are close to it. There's a chance one of the zombies exposed to the spore will start mutating. Look for visible changes and increased size as indicators.

5. **Kill Quickly**
As soon as you see a zombie start to mutate, kill it immediately. Use a powerful weapon to ensure it dies quickly. Weapons like shotguns or ray guns are more effective.
